    <h3>Assistance League - Operation School Bell (MIS 3353 – Database Management) Spring 2020</h3>
    <h3>Team Member - Database Creator/ Implementer and SQL Queries</h3>
    <h4>Jan 2020 - May 2020</h4>

    <p>Worked with the Assistance League of Norman (Not Real Association) to evaluate how a new database can assist one of their main projects, Operation School Bell (OSB), with becoming more efficient in their endeavor to provide clothing to nearly 1600 financially disadvantaged children in local school districts. OSB’s primary goal for a new database is to have accurate and timely data of the project’s available inventories in order to help ensure the maximum number of students are helped each school year.  The secondary goal is to provide efficiency and ease-of-use for management to run fast and accurate queries on data to help determine the amount of assistance provided and purchasing decisions for the fiscal year. 

    Created junk data to make the tables, created the relationships (cardinalities) between them in SQL Server through a virtual desktop, and wrote out SQL queries to output requested data.</p>
